# Contributing to HoneyLua

Thanks for taking the time to contribute!

## Workflow
1. **Fork** the repository on GitHub.
2. **Create a branch** from `main` for your change:
   - `git checkout -b my-change`
3. **Make your changes** (keep commits small and focused).
4. **Open a Pull Request** against `main`.

## Style guide
- Write **clean, readable Lua**.
- **No obfuscation**.
- Prefer clear names, small functions, and consistent formatting.
- Add/update comments and docs when behavior changes.

## Reporting issues
- For bugs, include:
  - reproduction steps
  - expected vs actual behavior
  - environment details (OS, Lua version, HoneyLua version)

## Code review
Be open to feedback. Reviews are meant to improve the code and keep maintenance easy.
